            <p>Welcome to my little page!</p>
            <p>I am Blorb, also known as confusedcatgirl, and I generate AI Artifacts as a Hobby!</p>
            <p>I also like to draw sometimes, and code in various languages from time to time.</p>
            <p>Most of the time, I am pretty laid back, and I like to talk about video games too!</p>
            <p>I like to mess around with game engines, and see what I can make with them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While I like to use AI tools, I am extremely hypocritical about using AI in business,</p>
            <p>or aggressively promoting it, or calling things that should not be called that an "AI".</p>
            <p>I also believe that AI is a tool that should be used more carefully, and not to create</p>
            <p>stuff like deepfakes. Another one of my beliefs is that AI media should be something</p>
            <p>that cannot be demanded money for. After all, it is essentially just copying homework.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This page is rather short as of right now, but I hope to extend it into a lot more!</p>

            <p>Running locally at my place, this server is only available to a select few. It has been properly configured to utilize HSTS and HTTPS.</p>
            <p>Only a select few, including myself, have access to it, mostly to manage tasks more easily, but also to store files etc.</p>
            <p>It is based on nextcloud, and is very easy to set up for your own home usage, so go check them out!</p>
