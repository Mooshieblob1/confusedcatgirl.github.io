	<p class="mb-1">Welcome to my little page!</p>
	<p>I am Blorb, also known as confusedcatgirl, and I generated AI Artifacts as a Hobby!</p>
	<p>I like to draw sometimes, and code in various languages from time to time.</p>
	<p>Most of the time, I am pretty laid back, and I like to talk about video games too!</p>
	<p>I like to mess around with game engines, and see what I can make with them.</p>
	<p>I am a former user of AI, due to various reasons, including my own mental health.</p>
	<p>Now, I 3d print models and paint them as a hobby, I might even share them on here!</p>
	<p>This page is rather short as of right now, but I hope to extend it into a lot more!</p>
